We did the measurements at varying distances with two ESP32 S3 and GPS.
ESP 1 was attached to the backside of the bicycle (under the seat)
ESP 2 was fixed at a height of 1 meter.
The GPS was simply attached to the bicycle.

The bicycle was rotated 90 degress to ESP 2.

At each distance 5 measurments were done (-i 5) with 64 FTM frames each (-c 64), equating to 64*5 frames (300 frames). The burst period was set to 5 (-p 5 [500ms]).

The header of data files is as follows: 
ID, Diag, RTT, T1, T2, T3, T4, RSSI, RTT_raw, RTT_est, Dist_est



TODO:
- ECDF
- Sort by order/time
- antenna diagram (walk around a bike, 30 degrees)
- gps data inserted (?)
- closer to wall/objects
- another experiment (get the same data)
- other gps modes (Windows VM)
- behind wall (unlikely, just once)
- moving bicycle (no too important)
- y-axis to meters
- gps configuration updated
- measurments next to house
